# :sparkling\_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

*   Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it. :D
*   Starring and sharing the project. :rocket:

Thanks! :heart:
